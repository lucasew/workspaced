# Demos and experiments

## Why this file exists

Workspaced’s CLI includes **showcase / experiment** entry points that are easy
to discover via tab-complete or casual `--help` browsing. They are **not** the
primary way to manage environments, tools, or drivers. This page keeps agents
from treating demos as the main API.

## Where demos live

### `workspaced experiments …`

Experimental / developer-oriented commands.

**`workspaced experiments demo`** (and subcommands) showcase **output rendering
and the taskgroup system** (progress, logs, optional bubbletea UI):

Examples of what that tree is for (names can grow; use `--help`):

| Invocation (pattern) | Intent |
|----------------------|--------|
| `experiments demo` / `… demo tasks` | Default taskgroup + UI showcase |
| `… demo plain` | Same scheduling **without** forcing the fancy renderer |
| `… demo nested` | Nested groups / explicit UI run |
| `… demo loop` | Logs + progress interaction |
| `… demo map` | Parallel map-style tasks |

These demos document **how workspaced itself renders work internally**, not how
to configure modules or install tools.

There may be other experiments (e.g. cue-related); always inspect
`workspaced experiments --help` for the build you have.

### `workspaced utils demo …`

Under **utils**, smaller demos (progress, debug-style helpers, etc.). Same idea:
**illustrative**, not core workflow.

Other **utils** (`shell init`, `template materialize`, icons, palette, nix
helpers, history, …) are real utilities — not all of `utils` is “demo,” but
`utils demo` specifically is.

## What is *not* a demo

Use these for real work:

| Area | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `home` / `codebase` | Plan/apply/lint/format/config |
| `mod` | Lock refresh |
| `tool` | Tools and `tool with` |
| `driver` | Live OS actions |
| `open` | Open/launch helpers |
| `init` / `self-install` | Bootstrap |

If the task is “fix my dotfiles / run go 1.22 once / change volume,” demos are
the wrong branch.

## When demos *are* appropriate

- Understanding workspaced’s **task/progress UI** behavior.
- Developing or debugging workspaced’s output layer (contributor context).
- Reproducing “what does the bubbletea path look like vs plain logs?”

They are optional for end users of modules/tools/drivers.

## Gotchas

- **Agent maps `experiments demo` to “primary tutorial”** — it teaches task UI,
  not modules/templates/tools.
- **Demo failures are synthetic or illustrative** — e.g. simulated errors in demo
  code are not necessarily bugs in the user’s config.
- **`TERM=dumb` / CI / non-TTY** — fancy demo UI may no-op to plain output; that
  doesn’t mean workspaced is broken for normal commands.
- **Utils vs experiments** — both can contain demos; core product surface is
  still `home` / `codebase` / `mod` / `tool` / `driver`.
- **Don’t apply lessons from demo scheduling to module apply** — different
  subsystems entirely (`plan-and-apply.md`).
